# ProjectWarden
Mobile application that allows users to review property landlording in the Belfast area.

This is the codebase for Project Warden (as yet, the final product has not been titled). It is a cross-platform mobile application that allows users to review landlording of properties within the Belfast area (with plans to expand). Users can select a property via searching an address or submit a review to said address. Reviews are by default filtered by most recent and most extensively detailed. 

Project Warden is developed cross-platform on Xamarin with Visual Studio.
